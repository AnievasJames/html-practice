Day-12

One of the most fun and challenging day of my learning journey.

I practiced margins, display properties, height and width.

I did not save any new codes today but i repetitively tried re-creating navbars from different websites.

I specifically learned the difference between divs, spans, inline and block elements.

I also tried experimenting different things using lists by naming tags on it using an id or grouping it with a class, and using the "display: flex" with justify-content in various ways.
