Day 4

I started becoming too distracted already, not because i dont like practicing anymore but our finals week is becoming really hard.

I came across a video about git and GitHub and realized that it's a good thing to implement it while practicing everyday so I 

could force myself to learn each day even just for a bit.

- First day using git and git hub, it's still messy right now and still familiarizing what these tools can do.

- Learned how to git add . > git commit -m "state the changes" > git push so hopefully the next few days I'll be more comfortable with it.
