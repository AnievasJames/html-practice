Day-7

Only had 10-15 minutes to practice since it's the last 2 days of our finals week.

Learned some new basics.....

- Lists- ul, ol and dl
- Tables- table, tr, th, td
- Favicons

In addition to this day, I made a simple loading screen.

I know understand the basics on how to define an animation and how to apply it on a class or div.
