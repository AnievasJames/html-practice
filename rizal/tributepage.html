    José Rizal (born June 19, 1861, Calamba, Philippines died December 30, 1896, Manila) 
    was a patriot, physician, and man of letters who was an inspiration to the Philippine nationalist movement.

    The son of a prosperous landowner, Rizal was educated in Manila and at the University of Madrid. A brilliant 
    medical student, he soon committed himself to the reform of Spanish rule in his home country, though he 
    never advocated Philippine independence. Most of his writing was done in Europe, where he resided between 1882 and 1892.

    In 1887 Rizal published his first novel, Noli me 
    tangere (The Social Cancer), a passionate exposure of the evils of Spanish rule in the Philippines. A sequel,
    El filibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed),  established his reputation as the leading spokesman 
    of the Philippine reform movement. He published an annotated edition (1890; reprinted 1958) of Antonio 
    Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, hoping to show that the native people of the Philippines had a 
    long history before the coming of the Spaniards. He became the leader of the Propaganda Movement, 
    contributing numerous articles to its newspaper, La Solidaridad, published in Barcelona. Rizal’s 
    political program included integration of the Philippines as a province of Spain, representation in 
    the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), the replacement of Spanish friars by Filipino priests, freedom of 
    assembly and expression, and equality of Filipinos and Spaniards before the law.

    Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1892. He founded 
    a nonviolent-reform society, the Liga Filipina, in  Manila, and was deported to Dapitan in northwest 
    Mindanao. He remained in exile for the next four years. In 1896 the Katipunan, a Filipino nationalist 
    secret society, revolted against Spain. Although he had no connections with that organization and he had had no part in the insurrection, Rizal was arrested 
    and tried for sedition by the military. Found guilty, he was publicly executed by a firing squad in Manila. 
    His martyrdom convinced Filipinos that there was no alternative to independence from Spain. On the eve of 
    his execution, while confined in Fort Santiago, Rizal  wrote “Último adiós” (“Last Farewell”), a masterpiece of 19th-century Spanish verse.
