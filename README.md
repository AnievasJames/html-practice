My daily HTML/CSS practice
I started about 3-4 days ago, i was too pumped at the beginning and yesterday I noticed that my practices are becoming inconsistent, especially we're having our finals week on College. Even 10-20 minutes of practice a day is very meaningful for me, so to put more excitement on my practices, I decided to record it on my github since this is my first day trying to use it after having an account for years.
